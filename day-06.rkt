(require rackunit)

; Input is simple today, so i hand-coded it to a simple file. The file
; provides the variable in, which is a list of pairs of numbers. The
; first number is the time, the second the distance. Also provides
; in-pt2, as the input for part 2.
(require "day-06-input.rkt")

; This require provides in-test. Similar to in (above) but with
; smaller numbers.
(require "day-06-input-test.rkt")

; To solve this puzzle, we find the zeroes to the following equation:
;
;   press_duration * (time - press_duration) - distance = 0
;
; This simplifies to:
;
;   - press_duration ^ 2 + time * press_duration - distance = 0
;
; The formula that solves this is:
;
;   - ( b (+/-) (sqrt D) ) / ( 2 * a )
;
; With a = -1, b = time, c = - distance and:
;
;   D = b ^ 2 - 4 * a * c

; Negative case

; Solves the question to the nearest included integer. Returns null if
; no way to win, otherwise a pair of lowerbound upperbound. Upperbound
; is included in the range.
