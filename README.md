# Advent of Code 2023
This repository contains my attempt at the advent of code 2023.

My goals were simple:

- Play around with Racket
- Experiment with writing (bad) parsers
- Perhaps learn something

I would like to think I attained the first goal. Everything in this
repository is written in Racket, after all. The second goal was
reached as well: bad parsers are ubiquitous. It is interesting to see
the parser being split up into smaller functions as the days go
on. Lastly, day 12 part 2 left me at a loss. To solve it, I learned
about nondeterministic state machines, which resulted in an
interesting solution, I think. That makes three for three goals
accomplished.

There were a couple of non-goals for this attempt as well:

- Write legible code
- Finish the advent of code

Again, I think I managed to hold myself to these non-goals quite
well. The code reads rather poorly. Fortunately I am sometimes very
long-winded in comments, which makes some parts at least somewhat
legible. In the end I managed to not finish the attempt as well. Day
14 part 1 is the last puzzle I managed to complete.

All in all this was a very interesting and fun set of challenges.
